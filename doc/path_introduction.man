[vset PROJECT] is a set of 4 related Tcl packages for the interning of
paths, i.e. the creation of a mapping from lists of strings to unique
integer identifiers. The differences between the packages are mainly
what type of storage is used.

[section {Extensibility}]

While the current set of packages should cover most to all of the
common cases where is always the possibility of encountering
unanticipated situations.

project. In the case of custom storage backends such a package has to
be derived from the base class provided by [package [vset PROJECT]].
